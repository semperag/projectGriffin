                    <p>24.	Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.</p>
                    <p>For the most part, I did do a steady flow of commits. At some point I stopped working for a week or more and then got back to work. Other times, I copied and pasted my css file into others one, which makes I looked like I had major changes, while I wrote barely any original code(I still had code that I only wrote). P.S. I deleted code in these files and put them into a shared css file (I just read the requirements).</p>
